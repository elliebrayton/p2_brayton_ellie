					<h2>FAQ</h2>
          <p>We know you’ve got a busy life, so why wait for us to answer if you can find out instantly? We are living in the modern age of technology, instant gratification is all we need</p>
          <div class="accordion_container">
            <div class="accordion_head">Where are you located?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>We’re a pop up shop in Tallahassee, FL. We announce where we are going to be about a week beforehand. Some of the places we’ve been privileged to serve are; Florida State University, PRIDEfest, and North Florida Vegfest. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">What does ‘clean’ ingredients mean?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>Clean ingredients mean we do not use any animal by-products. Livestock and their byproducts account for  51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. We do not wish to contribute to these emissions, so we are completely dairy-free & egg-free!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">I’m not vegan, can I still eat your goods? <span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>Of course! However, if you have a nut allergy or a soy allergy, be sure to read the ingredients before consuming.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">Will CBD make you high?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>Not at all! Many people claim that they feel an overall ‘calm effect’, but it is NOT a ‘high’. THC is a psychoactive cannabinoid, meaning it alters your mind, and creates a ‘euphoric high’. Due to our CBD oil being derived from hemp, it has .3% or less of THC, you will not feel ‘high’.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">Will CBD make me fail a drug test?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>According to the Director of Science and Technology at Quest Diagnostics, Barry Sample, CBD likely won’t show up on a drug test. Since, CBD derived from hemp contains such low levels of THC, it is highly unlikely for one to fail a marijuana drug test. These tests screen for THC and not CBD. The only possible, and unlikely way, for one taking CBD to test positive on a marijuana drug test is if they were to take over 2,000 mg of CBD</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">Will I notice a difference after I eat one of your goods with CBD?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>Not right away. It depends on what you’re doing! You’ll start “feeling something” after about an hour. If you are inactive, like laying in bed, sitting watching T.V., sitting at your computer etc. you will most likely get sleepy! However, if you are active, like running errands, going to the gym, talking with friends, etc., you will most likely feel less stressed.</p>
              <p>Note that this is not an overwhelming feeling. You may not even notice it is happening to begin with! But trust us, the CB1 and CB2 receptors in your body are hard at work!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">How does pre-ordering work?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>It’s easy! Head on over to our pre-order page and fill out the form with; your name, phone number, email, birthday, selection of what desserts you want, and write in the message box how many of each.  Keep in mind, this guarantees a dessert for you only when picking it up between 11:45AM-3PM.  Any time after that and you risk the chance of your dessert being sold to another lucky customer. </p>
              <p>Please note this is only for Market Wednesday on Florida State University campus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">Can I overdose on CBD?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>There is no known lethal dose of CBD and users have stated positive results in dosages up to 1500mg per day (75 of our desserts!). So while the proper dosage amount is different for every person, one cannot overdose on CBD. However, there can be some adverse side effects while using CBD in high dosages for extended periods of time like; dry mouth, lightheadedness, mild low blood pressure and sedation. However, these are not typical</p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion_head">You put CBD and caffeine together. How does that work if CBD is supposed to calm people and caffeine makes them energized?<span class="plusminus">+</span></div>
            <div class="accordion_body">
              <p>This is a kind of complicated answer, but here is it in layman’s terms. Caffeine binds to A2a receptors in your body and competes with adenosine (a compound that can help keep your heartbeat at a regular pace) and ultimately wins. This causes your heart rate to quicken, which is why some people get extremely jittery when drinking coffee. </p>
              <p>CBD also binds to receptors in the body in order to produce a biological response. CBD basically tells the body to calm down by helping regulate your heart rate. So while the caffeine is giving you energy and maybe making your heart rate increase, CBD comes in to help calm your heart rate down, but it doesn’t kill your energy. </p>
              <p>It can also help stop or slow down the enzyme that digests caffeine, lowering it’s metabolic rate and therefore elongating the energized effects of caffeine. It certainly depends on how much of each substance you take of course. Never consume large amounts of caffeine, even if you take CBD, as it can make your heart rate speed up.</p>
