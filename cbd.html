						<h3>What is CBD?</h3>
							<p> CBD is short for Cannabidiol, a phytocannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. CBD is not addictive or psychoactive. It is often mistaken as tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, but they are not the same. They both have medical benefits, but they work in different ways. First, CBD does not make someone feel “high” or “stoned”. In fact, a lot of CBD users say they do not particularly notice a change. They feel more calm than they were before, but it is not a drastic change like THC produces. Many times CBD users note that they would have felt extremely stressed without taking the CBD rather than “felt it”.  In fact, CBD can lessen the effects of THC. For example, if someone were to have too much THC in their system and start feeling anxious, they could take CBD to help calm them down. This is because CBD and THC interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors in the Endocannabinoid system differently. THC works directly with these receptors, hence it is a psychoactive as it directly affects your brain. It has a strong binding affinity to both receptors. CBD indirectly works with these receptors.  </p>
							<p>All in all, CBD interacts indirectly with receptors in the endocannabinoid system, has the opposite effect of THC, and has many medicinal benefits. To learn more about the medical benefits of CBD click here. To learn about the endocannabinoid system, read below! </p>

            <h3>Endocannabinoid System</h3>
              <p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS), is an essential system present in all mammals. It is mainly found in the nervous, limbic, and immune systems in order to help create homeostasis (Sulak, 2015).  It basically helps the body eat, sleep, and relax. One can compare it to a ‘lock and key’ type system.  The cannabinoid receptors act as locks, while the cannabinoids act as keys. The receptors are activated by (Lu and Mackie, 2017): <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Endogenous Cannabinoids</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Produced within the body</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Plant cannabinoids</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Such as cannabidiol (CBD)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Synthetic cannabinoids</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Example: HU-210</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                </p>
              <p>There are two known receptors: CB1 and CB2. CB1 can mainly be found in the brain; hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, Also in the central nervous system, intestines, connective tissues, gonads, and other glands. CB2. can be found in the; spleen, tonsils, thymus, and immune cells  (CBD Oil Review, 2018).  Due to its placement in the body, when CB1 is activated, it can help; relieve depression (Valverde and Torrens, 2012), decrease blood pressure (Godlewski, 2004), reduce anxiety, decrease fear and paranoia (Hill and Patel, 2013), and so much more. Much like a coin, there is another side to the reactions of the activation of  CB1. It can lead to decreased thyroid hormones(da Veiga et al., 2008), increased appetite (Di Marzo et al., 2001), constipation(Wright, K L et al., 2007) and more. However, most of these adverse side effects are due to potent CB1 receptor agonist, like THC and not CBD.  That being said, CBD does not really have a binding affinity for either receptor, meaning it does not activate either. Instead, all the effects CBD has on our bodies is made by indirect action to these receptors.  </p>

            <h3>Hemp Oil VS. CBD Oil</h3>
              <p>While our CBD oil comes from the hemp plant, it is not hemp oil. These two oils indeed come from the same plant, but are entirely different. Hemp oil, also known as hemp seed oil, comes from hemp seeds. This oil contains a high amount of protein and fatty oils with almost no saturated fat (National Hemp Association, 2018). It also contains no phytocannabinoids. It is commonly used for cooking, as it has a nutty taste, or in lotions, as it helps hydrate skin. CBD oil is derived from the flowers and leaves of either the hemp or marijuana plant.  It contains CBD which is a phytocannabinoid that has many health benefits. Due to this, CBD oil is primarily used to treat pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and more.</p>

            <h3>What is the Right Dosage?</h3>
              <p>There is currently no recommended daily allowance dose for all people and most medical schools do not not even cover CBD in their pharmacology courses. Due to that, this is only going to be an informational guide and <span class="bold italic">should not be considered medical advice</span>.  Everyone is different and these differences can have an impact on what the ‘right’ dose is for you. Some of these factors include; weight, metabolism, genetics, and diet. While everyone has an ECS, these can influence how quickly and effectively it works within a person’s body. This is why our CBD infused products contain 20mg. After countless hours of research, we believe this to be the best starter dose one could have to feel effects, without receiving any adverse effects.  However, if you find this is not working, feel free to get some oil and try for yourself! We recommend recording the amount, time, feelings before, and feelings after you have taken CBD in order to keep track of what dosage is working and what is not. </p>
